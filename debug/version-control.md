# Version Control

Version control is a way of tracking the changes made to files over time by different people, such as the code for a website or another application. It allows people to track the revision history of code and to revert or apply changes easily via the command line. It is also a good way to debug your website if something goes wrong, as you can quickly restore to a previous state of the site's code without restoring from a full backup.

A lot of WordPress hosts offer version control but there are third-party services and self hosted options as well.
