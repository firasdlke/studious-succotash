•	Accept the terms of End-User License Agreement and click Install button 
•	Relax and wait for some time to let the installation be finalized. 
•	Click on the Login link. No worries about “secure connection warnings”, just make an exception.

WP Toolkit 

WordPress Toolkit is a single management interface that enables you to easily install, configure, and manage WordPress. It is available if the WordPress Toolkit extension is installed in Plesk. WP Toolkit can install, configure, and manage WordPress version 3.7 or later.

Installing WordPress

The WP Toolkit extension is free with the Web Pro and the Web Host Plesk editions and is available for a fee for the Web Admin edition.

•	For an express installation, click Install (Quick). The latest version of WordPress will be installed, and the default settings will be used. The new instance will be available via HTTPS if SSL/TLS support is enabled for the domain.

•	If you want to change the default installation settings, click Install (Custom). This enables you to set up the administrator user, select the desired WordPress version, specify the database name, select auto-update settings, and more.
Note: To install WordPress, WordPress Toolkit retrieves data from wordpress.org. By default, if WordPress Toolkit cannot establish connection in 15 seconds, wordpress.org is considered to be unavailable.

Managing WordPress Instances
Go to WordPress to see all your WordPress instances. WordPress Toolkit groups information about each instance in blocks we call cards.

A card shows a screenshot of your website and features several controls that give you easy access to frequently used tools. The screenshot changes in real time to reflect the changes you make to your website. For example, if you switch the maintenance mode on or change the WordPress theme, the screenshot of the website will change immediately.
